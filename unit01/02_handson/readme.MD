# RGB Color Picker
## Objectives

Create an application that allows the user to visualize colors by changing the intensity of each RGB color to produce a new one.

To exercise some concepts as:
* HTML elements
  * and their attributes (id, class, etc)
* CSS
* 'Vanilla' JavaScript
  * QuerySelector document method usage
  * Events handling
  * Functions (including arrow functions)
  * CSS manipulation

## Requirements
* The application shall contain 3 inputs of type 'range', with values ranging from 0 to 255, to represent the intensity of red, green and blue colors, in this order
* For each range input, a read-only text box shall be provided to show the current value selected in the input
* The values generated by changing the range inputs shall be combined to set the background color of a container ('div')
* The container's background color shall be updated when any of the range inputs' value changes
 
## Development Tips
* Listen to 'load' event to guarantee that page is completely loaded before running any JavaScript code
* Identify the elements to easily access them by using 'document.querySelector' method on your script
* The container color can be changed by setting the 'style.backgroundColor' property by using the ['rgb()' functional notation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value) and template literals

```javascript
  document.querySelector(
    '#color-box'
  ).style.backgroundColor = `rgb(${r},${g}, ${b})`;
```
* If you want to show the hexadecimal notation of the color to the user, take a look on this [StackOverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3942878/how-to-decide-font-color-in-white-or-black-depending-on-background-color/3943023#3943023) to change the text color accordingly (the code to do so is available with my solution)
